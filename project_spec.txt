PROJECT OVERVIEW
Project Title: Charity Crowdfunding System
Tech Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Many people with genuine causes struggle to reach potential donors. Traditional fundraising lacks transparency, and donors cannot easily verify campaigns. There is no system to track donations or provide instant updates, leading to trust issues and delayed contributions.
